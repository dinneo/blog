## how to learn _(in simple 4 skills)_

1. Deconstruct the skill - 
	**Set your goal**, deconstruct the skill in smaller pieces
2. Learn enough to self-correct -
	**Get few resources** to learn, otherwise it is procrastination
3. Remove practive barriers -
	**Remove all distraction** like internet or any barrier
4. Practive at least 20 hrs -
	**Avoid frustation** by pre-committing to practicing

> The major barrier to skill acquisition isn't intellectual...it's **emotional**
