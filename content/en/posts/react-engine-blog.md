This is the place where I want to share some ideas. I wanted a great _writing & developing_ experience, while the design should be simple, yet graceful. My writinng skills neither english is good as I'd like, but I'm going to do the best I can to write great content.

## stack 

This blog is generated as a static content by a react engine called [Phenomic][https://phenomic.io/]. The engine basically rely on webpack and loaders to generate a website in React.

The theme was heavily inspired by the awesome [apollo theme][https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo] for hexo.
