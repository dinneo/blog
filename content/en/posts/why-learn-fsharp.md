description: F# is a hybrid paradigm language with focus on function programming. Is awesome for doing real world tasks. Is strongly typed and has many great features. Has a great community and you can use the .NET ecosystem tools.

My first contact with functional programming was with Haskell. I was amazed about the functional world. About how I had to think differently to solve a trivial problem like fibonacci or even sum a list of integers. Thanks a lot to **Mario Leston Rey** from bottom of my heart for this and other awesome teachings.

But the sad truth is that I didn't care. I kept my studies in C# and JS, beyond the graduation  subjects of computer science. Haskell was so distant from my day a day web development, that I thought FP was only to improve my algorithmic skills. This was around 2012.

Many things happened since then. Functional programming was increasingly gained traction. A lot of languages was born or just emerged. Functional approaches was incorporated in languages, frameworks with strongly functional bias was raised. So I read a great [post](https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9) from [Ju Gonçalves](https://twitter.com/cyberglot) in 2015 that made me go back to study functional again.

So this time I had to try something less academic, and more real world. Scala was the way to go. I started the creator's [course](https://pt.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) on coursera, but I was lost in few weeks. All the things, in some way, were really abstract to me. Unfortunately I gave up again.

# the path

So how I really started to learn functional programming? I wont't give a recipe, like _"set clear goals"_, _"manage your time"_, etc. They don't help with nothing. But I will say what exactly worked for me, and there are 2 main purposes.

## 1. it is hard

If you are like me, the guy who loves the many javascript frameworks, or being productive with new tools that you have just discovered, probably you will get frustrated.

Ju Gonçalves already said that, in the previous post I mentioned

> Every thing is hard at first. I'm sure you've struggled to learn how to program and even to learn OOP. Probably start doing something in OOP was way easier than your first program. Mainly because you're already familiar with some common idioms, like variable declaration and for/while loops. <br/><br/>
> For starting with FP, it's almost like starting to learn how to program again, from scratch (depending on which language you'd start, it'll be definitely like starting over again).

But I'm going to emphasize, to learn a new paradigm is hard. Is like learning a new language, from another country, with other cultures, you have to learn from scratch, you won't be able to do simple tasks, and will be boring at first.

Understand this barrier will be the first step to understand whatever new paradim you want to learn, including FP. You can look for ways to make the path smoothier.

estuda o que voce manja (prefira compilado, mas se voce prefere dinamico vai de dinamico, o impoertante e tu ta confortavel)

Faca uma aplicacao real com o que vocce esta aprendendo, mesmo que seja lixo.

Isso serviu para mim, pode servir para mais alguem, NOIX bixao!
