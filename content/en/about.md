Hi! I'm Edney Pitta, a full stack web and mobile developer with 5 years of experience.
I work in SÃ£o Paulo at Lambda3 building applications with React, Node.js and .NET and am also a freelancer.

I like to solve problems and create value with software. I'm always looking for more effective ways of doing it, be it choosing the right tool for the job or finding a better solution to a business problem.
